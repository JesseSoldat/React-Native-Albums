Open up a second terminal window in the project directory and run 'npm run start'.  This will start up the packager.  Sometimes react native fails to start it up on its own.

1 - start AVD
2 - npm run start
3 - react-native run-android


Debugging
-----------------------------------------------------
1 - Ctrl + M to open up some "developer menu"
2 - click on enable remote JS debugging
3 - Depending on your react native version, chrome may or may not open up the debugging tab. But in any case, go to localhost:8081/debugger-ui should do it.
